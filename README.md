# I am a Hacker
s4Lab - I am a hacker

1. I have summarized two papers. You can find the summaries in [summaries/](https://github.com/Javad-Alipanah/i-am-a-hacker/tree/master/summaries)

2. For the first question about git exposure by websites I have recorded a video which you can find in [videos/](https://github.com/Javad-Alipanah/i-am-a-hacker/tree/master/videos).

...I simply showed how to use directory listing along with git exposure to recover all website's source code.

...Although there is another situation where the directory listing is not enabled and you should be familiar with how a versioning system (here git) works. Shortly in this situation either you can recover all source code through a recursive approach.
